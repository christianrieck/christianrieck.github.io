Hi there! I am a postdoc at <a href='https://www.mathematik.uni-kassel.de/Rieck'>University of Kassel</a> in the research group on discrete mathematics led by [Torsten Mütze](http://tmuetze.de/).

My research interests are in theoretical computer science and discrete mathematics, particularly in computational geometry, graph theory, and combinatorics. 
I am especially interested in reconfiguration and guarding problems arising in these areas.

Keywords: Algorithms and complexity, graphs and geometry, geometric and combinatorial optimization, reconfiguration, guarding and covering, Hamiltonicity and tours.

In 2023, I received my PhD from TU Braunschweig, supervised by [Sándor Fekete](https://www.ibr.cs.tu-bs.de/users/fekete/).
